# Surfs_Up
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze weather patterns on Oahu from the years 2010-2017 to deem whether or not opening a year-round surf shop can be viable. The tools used in this analysis include Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
By querying the data, creating a datafame, and extracting leading statistics for the months of June and Decemeber, weather extremes could be compared to gain the most accurate picture of the surf's shop viability based on the weather data. 

## Results

## Summary
The difference between the mean temperatures for December and June is about 5 degrees. Relatively, having a 5 degree temperature difference in the higher temperature ranges should not make surfing less viable. Further analysis should be conducted based on other factors such as precipitation to gain more insight whether or not its viable to keep the surf shop open year-round.
